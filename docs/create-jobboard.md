Fill in the [subdomain](#what-is-the-subdomain) you want. Then the title, subtitle and description of your job board  and
click on the **"Create your job board"** button. You can fill these 3 fields with the first idea that comes to your mind,
they are all editable later. To modify the subdomain, send us an email at the address [admin@roleup.com](mailto:admin@roleup.com).

## What is the subdomain?

When you create your job board, RoleUp gives a default web address to it. The first part of this default web address is
the subdomain that you choose.
