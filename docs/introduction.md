This is the documentation for [RoleUp Jobboard](https://roleup.com), an easy to use and free SAAS to create a job board.

While RoleUp is a SAAS (Software As A Service), it is, without coding, as customizable than any Wordpress job board plugin.
As it is a SAAS and free, there is others advantages adding up:
- You don't have to worry about the hurdles of a Wordpress installation
- You don't have to choose one of the plugins when they all look the same
- You don't have to choose among dozens of hosting solutions
- No need to hire a developer
- No operational cost
- etc...
